_(A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?)_

# Introduction
Films play an important role in perpetuating ideas and stereotypes, and gender is no exception. Traditionally, female characters have been portrayed in the roles of mothers, wife, girlfriend, or sex object motifs while male actors have dominated the leading roles. With the rise of feminism in the 1960s, 1990s, and more recently in the 2010's especially with the rise of movements such as the MeToo movement, we must ask whether improvements have been made to the respresentation of female characters in films. Using the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, we seek to study the disparity between the representation of female and male characters.

An initial analysis of the data already reveals discrepencies in the representation of female and male actors. We see that the average age of female and male characters is vastly different. We can see that on average, female actors are 32.96 years old, while their male counterparts are 40.47. Perhaps what is more striking is the shape of the kernel densities. Although both are skewed towards the tail, the female curve looks more skewed compared to the male. This could be an indication of the diversity of roles played by male and female actors or a lack there of.

Looking at the proportions of male and female actors reveals a more striking difference. Across all the years shown, in all but one year, the average proportion of roles occupied by female casts is lower that the male counterparts. What is more, is that this difference does not improve until an insignificant increase in 2014. 

Treating each year as a sample, we can look at the average of the proportions in each year across the sexes. We see unsurprisingly that there is a lower proportion of female actors in a given year.
